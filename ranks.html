            This game was really fun to play. Its artstyle is very unique and I
            enjoyed the game mechanics. I've played through the almost 100 hour
            story twice and have lost many afternoons <br />
            and nights playing this game.

            In terms of worldbuilding, this JRPG series takes the cake in my
            book. Honestly, I consider this series and the persona series equal.
            The only reason this is 2nd on the <br />
            list is because Persona 5 was the first JRPG I fully devoted myself
            to, and the rest is history.

          <p>
            Mass Effect is a really good Sci-Fi trilogy (we don't talk about
            Andromeda.). I was almost immediately hooked and absorbed into the
            world and became invested in the <br />
            story and characters. There is so much replayability as well, as the
            choices you make shape the story.

            This MMO is really fun, to say the least. You can play through so
            much content through the free trial alone, and it's definitely even
            more fun to play with friends. The <br />
            game mechanics aren't to hard to grasp initially, though I think the
            skill ceiling can seem pretty high to someone who's never played an
            MMO before.

            This game will always hold a special place. This game, that probably
            not a lot of people my age have heard of, was the first game I ever
            remember playing. Growing up I <br />
            would watch my dad play games and I vividly remember him playing
            this when I was still in preschool. I revist this game from time to
            time whenever I need some nostalgia.
