        <h4>My Thoughts</h4>
        <p>
          I was able to intern there last summer and the summer of 2021. In both
          instances, it was a blast being able to gain some real world
          experience. I've had the pleasure of helping the team I was working
          with
          implement new pages, fix defects, spike future implementations, as
          well as help QA members by doing QA myself. Each task sent my way was
          its own learning experience and getting to know and work
          more closely with a team was very fun. I plan on taking the
          experiences and knowledge that I've gained and apply them where I can
          so hopefully any team I work with will be successful.
